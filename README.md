[DEMO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rQVq4hEikbvjXucrD2ubmYWzne4x9Ulh/view?usp=sharing)

## Overview  

The **Automotive Repair Voice Agent** is an end-to-end, real-time voice assistant that allows customers to describe vehicle issues naturally and receive:
- **Instant service recommendations** based on symptoms  
- **Accurate cost and time estimates**  
- **Available appointment slots** via Google Calendar  
- **Automated booking confirmations**

The system transforms a traditionally manual, phone-based workflow into a **24/7 conversational experience** that reduces friction, saves staff time, and improves customer satisfaction.

---

## Problem & Motivation  

Traditional auto-repair scheduling relies on manual calls:  
> ‚ÄúMy car is making a rattling sound, can I book a check?‚Äù  

This leads to:
- Long hold times during peak hours  
- Inconsistent price estimates  
- Missed leads due to limited business hours  

Our solution uses **AI voice automation** to enable self-service booking with human-like dialogue and consistent pricing ‚Äî delivering **machine efficiency with a human touch**.
